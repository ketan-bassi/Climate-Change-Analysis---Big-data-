# Climate-Change-Analysis---Big-data

## Introduction
Climate Change is one of the most debatable topic now days. But what exactly is causing this climate change and how is it impacting our environment. Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.Some of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are CO2 , methane , nitrogen.

Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, at a time when they need to be rapidly falling. To effectively reduce emissions we need to know where they are coming from – which sectors contribute the most? How can we use this understanding to develop effective solutions and mitigation strategies?

The world emits around 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases each year and about 24% of this comes from energy use in industries, various transports like road, aviation, shipping contributes around 16% to the total emission. And Residential and commercial buildings also contributes to about 17.5% to these gases. The Agriculture, forestry and land use are also not far behind, emitting around 18% of the global green house gases.

In this project we will be analysing the effect of greenhouse gases on temperature and precipitation in Canada and its provinces and compare it to the rest of the world.
